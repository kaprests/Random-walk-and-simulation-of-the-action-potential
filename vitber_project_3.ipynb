Additionally the system has edges at $\\pm L/2$ where the particles cannot pass.

This is to be expected when the concentration of ions inside the membrane approaches the concentration of ions outside. With a negative voltage over the membrane, the sodium ions will flow into the cell along the diffusion gradient.

As the voltage increases, the flow of ions in and out will become more balanced between the respective ions.

When the voltage is equal to or below $-70$ mV the sodium gate opens and its potential is set to a lowered value $V_{open}$. Sodium ions will therefor flow freely through the gate until the voltage reaches $30$ mV when the sodium gate is closed, its value returned to $\\beta V^0_{Na} = \\beta V^0$ while the potassium gate is now opened.\n",

The system then acts similarly to what happened in task 7.2, with a closed potassium gate, until the voltage reaches the maximum value and the potassium gate opens while the sodium gate closes. The voltage now settles around a similar value as the same case from 7.2. The voltage may reach the minimum value again sparking another shooting volt signal or settle without reaching the minimum value through our system."
